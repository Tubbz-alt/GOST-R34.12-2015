== Intro

Verilog HDL implementation of the GOST R34.12-2015 - a fresh Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher.

NOTE: Russian description available here: http://idoka.ru/crypto-ip-core-gost-r3412-2015/

=== Short Chipher Detail

|===============================================
| *Date published* | 2015
| *Structure*      | Substitution-permutation network
| *Key sizes*      | 256 bits
| *Block sizes*    | 128 bits
| *Rounds*         | 10
|===============================================


== Features

////
* SystemVerilog RTL and TB code is provided
* Implements both encryption and decryption in the same block
* GOST 28147-89 algorithm focusing on very low area applications
* Implementation takes about 32 cycles to encrypt/decrypt a block
* EBC-cipher mode support
* The core complies to use of S-box according to RFC4357/GOST R34.11-94 or RFC5830 (by synthesis), or S-box switch "on the fly" (realtime).
////

== Status

// * Core implementations have been tested on a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA succesfully

== Employment



=== Synthesis

////
Sample Synthesis Results for the ECB-mode

```
Technology         Size/Area  Speed/Performance
==============================================================
Xilinx Spartan-3E
```
////

== Limitations

// The design uses SystemVerilog as language for RTL-implementation therefore your Design Tools should support SystemVerilog for synthesis and simulation.


== ToDo

////
* Implementation testing with support Botan crypto-lib. It can be used in a DPI-based testbench as golden model or test vector generator
* Support for following cipher modes: CBC, CFB, OFB (and maybe CTR)
* Adding SoC-buses compatibility for seamless integration
